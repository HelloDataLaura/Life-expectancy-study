# 📊 Correlation Analysis: Life Expectancy & Rent by District

This project explores the correlation between **life expectancy** and **average rent** across multiple districts of the city of Valencia over time. Using Python, we analyze and visualize the relationship between these two variables to identify trends.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **data/** → Contains the raw dataset (`correlation_life_rent_OK.csv`).
- **notebooks/** → Contains notebooks for data exploration and visualization.
- **scripts/** → Python scripts used for data processing and visualization.
- **README.md** → Project overview and usage instructions.

## 🔍 Objective
To determine whether there is a correlation between:
- The **average rent** in a district.
- The **life expectancy** of its population.

## 📊 Data Processing & Visualization
Key steps performed:
1. **Data Cleaning** → Handled missing values and ensured proper data types.
2. **Grouping & Aggregation** → Calculated mean values per district per year.
3. **Rolling Mean Smoothing** → Used a 3-year moving average to smooth trends.
4. **Visualization** → Generated plots to analyze trends and relationships.

### 📌 Example Visualizations:
- **Line plots** of rent and life expectancy over time, grouped by district.
- **Scatter plots** with regression lines to examine correlations.
- **Box plots** to compare distributions across different districts.

## 📈 Key Findings
- Some districts show a **positive correlation** between rent and life expectancy.
- Other districts exhibit **no clear correlation**, suggesting other factors may influence life expectancy.
- Housing affordability **could be a determinant** of public health in some regions.
